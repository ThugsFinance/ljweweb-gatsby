#### About

This project is my first major rework of my personal website as well as my first `gatsby` project. Since I've created
my `create-react-app` website from scratch, I can now use the starters and plugins that `gatsby` provides confidently. The
website currently supports a landing, about, all projects, resume, and individual project pages. The site has custom styling (including a `dark mode`), audio support, locally hosted font(s), and the individual projects pages and the resume page are created using `MDX` (markdown for `JSX/React`). The backend of the website is supported by a `GraphQL` database, which the site queries for its content.

* Utilizes `Gatsby`, `GraphQL`, `Sass`, `SEO`, `MDX`
* `React` modules 
    * `React Bootstrap`
    * `React Context`
    * `React Helmet` to add `SEO` to the site making it easier for search engines to relate search keywords to your website
    * `Howler` to manage `audio` files
    * `Fontawesome` for high-quality icons

What is [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/)?
My project is based off of the [gatsby-personal-site-template](https://github.com/surudhb/gatsby-personal-site-template).
