import ProjectPageLayout from "../../../templates/projects-post";
export default ProjectPageLayout;

The primary purpose of this project was to serve as my personal portfolio website. Since then, I have redone the front end using `gatsby.js`.

#### Front End  

The front end is fairly straightforward. Theres a title line & some social links then theres a set of tabs that contain an about me page, a projects page, and a contact me page.

[See live demo](https://hungry-shirley-bd8024.netlify.app/)

* Front-end constructed with `React`, `Javascript`, `HTML`, `CSS`, and `Sass`
* Utilizes [**React**](<https://reactjs.org/>), [**React-Bootstrap**](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), [**React Router**](https://reactrouter.com/), [**react-social-icons**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-social-icons), [**node-sass**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass)
* `Dockerized` in own container with `nginx` on `port 80`  
* Redirects back end requests to `port 5000`
* About me, projects, and contact me pages
* Validation on contact me form

#### Back End

The back end written for the first iteration of my personal portfolio website. It is relatively simple, in that it only has a simple database model for users of the contact me form and a single endpoint that sends an email notification once someone submits the contact me form. The server launches using `Docker`.

* Contact me endpoint `(/contact)`
* Receives requests from front end through `Docker` container
* Utilizes [**Flask**](<https://github.com/pallets/flask>), [**Flask-SQLAlchemy**](<https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/>), [**Flask-Mail**](<https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Mail/>), [**Flask-Migrate**](<https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>), [**marshmallow**](<https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>), [**gunicorn**](<https://gunicorn.org/>)
* Visitor database model to track users who have submitted contact me forms
* Setup file and database initialization
* Containerized with Docker on `port 5000`
