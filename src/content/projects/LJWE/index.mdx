#### About

`LJWE` is an algorithmic and quantitative analysis library built to aid finance professionals with the analysis, underwriting, and execution of algorithmic and quantitative trading strategies. The library provides a data handler interface to handle multiple data sources and comes equipped with a lightweight back testing/calculation engine that takes these data sources and simulates historical trades with a provided set of parameters. Results are outputted as a dataframe and visualized through pyfolio for strategy-level analysis. The system is built to run through the python interpreter, because I want to be able to apply multiple interfaces to the project.

The system has numerous capabilities, but the core features are as follows:

* Run quantitative analytics on certain assets
* Ability to easily create and implement trading algorithms
* Ability to apply overarching portfolio-level logic to groups of trading algorithms
* Lightweight back testing engine
* Live trading capabilities
* Advanced portfolio analytics from `pyfolio`
* Database setup and management

This is a passion project of mine, and I try to apply new programming/design concepts within this context to help me better understand them. It has also served as a helpful way for me to channel my past experience in the investment industry into an applied project. I intend to use this system for my personal trading decisions.
