#### About

`LJWE` is a `quantitative analysis` library built to aid finance professionals with the analysis, underwriting, and execution 
of `algorithmic` and `quantitative` trading strategies. The library utilizes numpy to quickly calculate technical indicators 
and simulate historical trades with user-defined logic. Results are outputted with strategy-level analysis using `pandas` and `pyfolio`.

This is a passion project of mine, and I try to apply new programming/design concepts within this context to help me better understand them. 
It has also served as a helpful way for me to channel my past experience in the investment industry into an applied project. 

#### Core Features

* Run `quantitative analytics` on certain assets
* Easily creatible and implement trading algorithms
* Ability to apply overarching portfolio-level logic to groups of trading algorithms
* Lightweight back testing engine
* Live trading capabilities
* Advanced portfolio analytics from `pyfolio`
* Database setup and management
